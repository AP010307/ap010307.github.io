&lt;p>I spearheaded a group of five people in an ELEC 291 project that utilized Intel&amp;rsquo;s 8051 microcontroller and assembly language to implement reflow soldering using a toaster oven.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="introduction">Introduction&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Reflow soldering was used to assemble surface-mounted-technology (SMT) devices onto printed circuit boards (PCBs). The process utilized solder paste (a mixture of solder flux and pellets with adhesive properties) to attach micro-components onto the PCBs. Once components were moderately secured on the pads, the board was placed into an oven, which was gradually heated according to a predetermined soldering profile. This profile included a customizable reflow time, reflow temperature, and soak time. During the heating process, the flux was activated, and the solder paste melted, soldering the components onto the PCB.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Coin picking robot</title><link>https://ap010307.github.io/portfolio/projects/robot_picking_up/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ap010307.github.io/portfolio/projects/robot_picking_up/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://github.com/AP010307/ELEC-291-Coin-Picking-Robot">ðŸ”— View on GitHub&lt;/a>

&lt;p>I spearheaded a group of five people in an ELEC 291 project that utilises the EFM8LB1 and ATMega32P microcontrollers to create a robot that is able to pick up 20 coins.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="introduction">Introduction&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>This project is the ultimatum of my ELEC 291 course, where my team was tasked with creating a robot that could pick up 20 coins. The robot was designed to be able to stay within a perimeter powered by AC signal while detecting and picking up coins using multipl solenoids.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
