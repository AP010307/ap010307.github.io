A SystemVerilog and ARM assembly project that creates a simple computer with basic arithmetics and memories.
Overview
This project is 3 labs combined into one project for CPEN 211, where we designed a  reduced set instruction computer (RISC) machine using SystemVerilog and ARM assembly on a De1-SoC board. The RISC machine is capable of performing basic arithmetic operations and memory operations.
Introduction
The project was divided into two parts: the SystemVerilog part and the ARM assembly part. The SystemVerilog part was to design the RISC machine using a finite state machine (FSM) and the ARM assembly part was to write a program that runs on the RISC machine. The RISC machine was designed to have a 16-bit data bus, 16-bit address bus, 16-bit registers, and 16-bit memory. The machine was capable of performing basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It was also capable of performing memory operations such as load and store."><meta name=author content="Allen Pham"><link rel=canonical href=https://ap010307.github.io/portfolio/projects/risc/><link crossorigin=anonymous href=/portfolio/assets/css/stylesheet.6da9a63d25a9608bca2f7f907a030e887a7dd3c3f3918e4cc113129361414bda.css integrity="sha256-bammPSWpYIvKL3+QegMOiHp908PzkY5MwRMSk2FBS9o=" rel="preload stylesheet" as=style><link rel=icon href=https://ap010307.github.io/portfolio/favicon.ico><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=https://ap010307.github.io/portfolio/favicon-16x16.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=https://ap010307.github.io/portfolio/favicon-32x32.png><link rel=apple-touch-icon href=https://ap010307.github.io/portfolio/apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=mask-icon href=https://ap010307.github.io/portfolio/safari-pinned-tab.svg><meta name=theme-color content="#2e2e33"><meta name=msapplication-TileColor content="#2e2e33"><link rel=alternate hreflang=en href=https://ap010307.github.io/portfolio/projects/risc/><noscript><style>#theme-toggle,.top-link{display:none}</style><style>@media(prefers-color-scheme:dark){:root{--theme:rgb(29, 30, 32);--entry:rgb(46, 46, 51);--primary:rgb(218, 218, 219);--secondary:rgb(155, 156, 157);--tertiary:rgb(65, 66, 68);--content:rgb(196, 196, 197);--code-block-bg:rgb(46, 46, 51);--code-bg:rgb(55, 56, 62);--border:rgb(51, 51, 51)}.list{background:var(--theme)}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-track{background:0 0}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb{border-color:var(--theme)}}</style></noscript><meta property="og:url" content="https://ap010307.github.io/portfolio/projects/risc/"><meta property="og:site_name" content="Allen Pham"><meta property="og:title" content="RISC Machine"><meta property="og:description" content="ðŸ”— View on GitHub

The RISC machine is capable of performing basic arithmetic operations and memory operations.\nIntroduction The project was divided into two parts: the SystemVerilog part and the ARM assembly part. The SystemVerilog part was to design the RISC machine using a finite state machine (FSM) and the ARM assembly part was to write a program that runs on the RISC machine. The RISC machine was designed to have a 16-bit data bus, 16-bit address bus, 16-bit registers, and 16-bit memory. The machine was capable of performing basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It was also capable of performing memory operations such as load and store.\nObjective The objective conveyed the following requirements:\nDatapath A register file containing 8 locations with 16-bit registers. A 16-bit ALU (Arithmetic logic unit) capable of performing addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Finite state machine controller A finite state machine that controls the datapath. The FSM should be able to perform the following operations: Load a value from memory to a register. Store a value from a register to memory. Perform arithmetic operations. Memory input and output A 16-bit memory that can store 256 16-bit values. The memory should be able to read and write values. Design Hardware The hardware only required the De1-SoC board.\nSystemVerilog The SystemVerilog design was divided into two parts: the datapath and the finite state machine controller.\nDatapath The datapath consisted of the following components:\nA 16-bit ALU. 8 16-bit registers. A 16-bit shifter. ALU ALUâ€™s lab 5 ALU lab 6 First, I declared ALU macros that represented 2-bit binary value. Then, I created a 16-bit ALU that could perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.\nValue on ALUop input Operation 00 Ain + Bin 01 Ain - Bin 10 Ain \u0026 Bin 11 ~Bin Register File Registerâ€™s diagram Registerâ€™s declaration For the register file, it took input data through a multiplexer which selected whether data was coming from the output or the external switches. It contained two 3-8 decoder that one selected the register to write to while the other chose which registerâ€™s output to continue. Shifter The shifter was used to shift the data to the left or right by 1 bit. It was used in the multiplication and division operations.\nshift Operation 00 B 01 B shifted left 1-bit, least significant bit is zero 10 B shifted right 1-bit, most significant bit, MSB is zero 11 B shifted right 1-bit, MSB is copy of B[15] Datapath Datapathâ€™s code |\nThe datapath file called all the components and connected them together. It took the input data from the ALU, the register file, and the shifter. It also took the input data from the memory and the output data from the memory. The datapath was controlled by the FSM controller.\nFinite State Machine Controller Instead of manually controlling the datapath, the FSM controller was used to control the datapath. The FSM controller was designed to have 6 states:\nWAIT: The initial state of the machine. DECODE: Load a value from memory to a register. MOV_IMM: Move an immediate value to a register. MOV_RM: Move a value from a register to memory. ADD: Perform addition. CMP: Perform comparison. AND: Perform bitwise AND. MVN: Perform bitwise OR. Writeback: Write the result back to the register. They also contain new components such as instructional register and decoder.\nInstructional register A simple instructional file that stored the current instruction according to the rising edge of the clock.\nInstructional Decoder Decoderâ€™s declaration Cont Decoderâ€™s declaration One of the most important components of the FSM controller was the decoder. The decoder took the 16-bit current instruction and and a 2 bit select for the multiplexer to output MOVE instructions and ALU operations. The 16-bit instruction was divided into 4 parts: the opcode, the destination register, the source register, and the immediate value. The opcode was used to determine the operation to be performed. The destination register was used to determine the register to write to. The source register was used to determine the register to read from. The immediate value was used to store the immediate value to be used in the operation.\nMemory input Despite the team are willing to work to create a final product, the memory was not implemented due to team memberâ€™s unforseen circumstances. The memory was supposed to be a 16-bit memory that could store 256 16-bit values. The memory was supposed to be able to read and write values.\nConclusion Overall, the project taught me how to design a simple computer using SystemVerilog and ARM assembly. I learned how to design a finite state machine that controlled the datapath. I also learned how to design a datapath that contained an ALU, a register file, and a shifter. I also learned how to design a decoder that decoded the current instruction. I also learned how to design a memory that could read and write values. The project was a great learning experience and I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in computer architecture.\nEven though the RSIC did not have a memory, the team was able to implement the ALU, the register file, the shifter, the FSM controller, and the decoder. The team was also able to implement the ALU operations, the MOVE operations, and the ALU operations. The team was also able to implement the FSM controller that controlled the datapath. The team was also able to implement the decoder that decoded the current instruction. The team was also able to implement the memory that could read and write values.\nAcknowledgement I want to thank my teammate Rio DaCosta for his unwavering dedication and hard work on this project.\n","wordCount":"995","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://ap010307.github.io/portfolio/logo.png","datePublished":"2025-02-14T16:46:16-08:00","dateModified":"2025-02-14T16:46:16-08:00","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Allen Pham"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://ap010307.github.io/portfolio/projects/risc/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Allen Pham","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ap010307.github.io/portfolio/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://ap010307.github.io/portfolio/ accesskey=h title="Allen Pham (Alt + H)">Allen Pham</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)" aria-label="Toggle theme"><svg id="moon" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://ap010307.github.io/portfolio/about/ title=About><span>About</span></a></li><li><a href=https://ap010307.github.io/portfolio/projects/ title=Projects><span>Projects</span></a></li><li><a href=https://ap010307.github.io/portfolio/electrical_engineering_resume__newest.pdf title=Resume><span>Resume</span></a></li><li><a href=https://ap010307.github.io/portfolio/blogs/ title=Blog><span>Blog</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://ap010307.github.io/portfolio/>Home</a>&nbsp;Â»&nbsp;<a href=https://ap010307.github.io/portfolio/projects/>Projects</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">RISC Machine</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2025-02-14 16:46:16 -0800 PST'>February 14, 2025</span>&nbsp;Â·&nbsp;5 min&nbsp;Â·&nbsp;Allen Pham</div></header><div class=toc><details><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><ul><li><a href=#overview aria-label=Overview>Overview</a></li><li><a href=#introduction aria-label=Introduction>Introduction</a></li><li><a href=#objective aria-label=Objective>Objective</a></li><li><a href=#design aria-label=Design>Design</a><ul><li><a href=#hardware aria-label=Hardware>Hardware</a></li><li><a href=#systemverilog aria-label=SystemVerilog>SystemVerilog</a><ul><li><a href=#datapath aria-label=Datapath>Datapath</a><ul><li><a href=#alu aria-label=ALU>ALU</a></li><li><a href=#register-file aria-label="Register File">Register File</a></li><li><a href=#shifter aria-label=Shifter>Shifter</a></li><li><a href=#datapath-1 aria-label=Datapath>Datapath</a></li></ul></li></ul></li><li><a href=#finite-state-machine-controller aria-label="Finite State Machine Controller">Finite State Machine Controller</a><ul><li><a href=#instructional-register aria-label="Instructional register">Instructional register</a></li><li><a href=#instructional-decoder aria-label="Instructional Decoder">Instructional Decoder</a></li></ul></li><li><a href=#memory-input aria-label="Memory input">Memory input</a></li></ul></li><li><a href=#conclusion aria-label=Conclusion>Conclusion</a></li><li><a href=#acknowledgement aria-label=Acknowledgement>Acknowledgement</a></li></ul></div></details></div><div class=post-content><p><a href=https://github.com/AP010307/CPEN_211_RSIC.git>ðŸ”— View on GitHub</a></p><p>A SystemVerilog and ARM assembly project that creates a simple computer with basic arithmetics and memories.</p><h1 id=overview>Overview<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#overview>#</a></h1><p>This project is 3 labs combined into one project for CPEN 211, where we designed a reduced set instruction computer (RISC) machine using SystemVerilog and ARM assembly on a De1-SoC board.
